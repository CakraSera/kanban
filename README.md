# Kanban

A simple and intuitive Kanban board application built with React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

## Overview

This application provides a visual way to manage tasks through different stages, typically represented as columns. You can easily create, move, and organize your tasks to streamline your workflow.

## Key Features

- **Board Creation:** Easily create new Kanban boards to organize different projects or areas of work.
- **Column Management:** Add, remove, and rename columns to match your specific workflow stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Task Management:**
  - Create new tasks with descriptions.
  - Drag and drop tasks between columns to update their status.
  - View and potentially edit task details (future enhancement).
- **Simple and Clean Interface:** Focuses on usability and ease of navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling applications.
- **Shadcn UI:** A component library providing accessible UI components that are easily customizable with Tailwind CSS.
- **TypeScript:** Adds static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code maintainability and reducing errors.
- **Vite:** A fast build tool that provides a quick and efficient development experience.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CakraSera/kanban.git
    cd kanban
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm dev  # or yarn start
    ```

    This will typically run the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

Once the application is running, you can:

- Create a new board (if this functionality is implemented in the UI).
- Add new columns by clicking the "Add Column" (or a similar) button.
- Create new tasks within a column using the "Add Task" (or a similar) button.
- Drag and drop tasks between columns to update their status.
